(Note: The below is just notes in outline form. It remains to flesh this out into a proper chapter.)

* the U.S. government is not permitted to claim copyright over any of it works, so all of its data is without a license—it's in the public domain
* [many states do not permit themselves or their subdivisions (e.g., cities, counties, towns) to claim copyright](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright_status_of_work_by_U.S._subnational_governments)—if your state is one of these, then all of your data is in the public domain, and you should state so explicitly in the metadata for all datasets that you publish
* if your state does permit itself to claim copyright, then you must determine for each dataset what its licensing status is
* there is no point in publishing data that is copyrighted under terms that prohibit it from being reused
* if you are in a position to do so, release copyrighted data under [a Creative Commons license](https://creativecommons.org/choose/), preferably a [Creative Commons Zero license](https://creativecommons.org/about/cc0), which waives copyright; this is arguably better than dedicating work to the public domain
* for more information, read _Open Government Data_’s “[Best-Practices Language for Making Data ‘License-Free’](http://theunitedstates.io/licensing/).”
