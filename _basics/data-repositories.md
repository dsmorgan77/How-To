# Introduction

* they provide a central, searchable place for people to find data
* some will automatically convert data from one format to others, so even though you can only provide CSV, it will generate XML, JSON, etc.
* some will visualize datasets right in the browser, letting people map, sort, search, and combine datasets, without knowing how to program
* some repositories can be syndicated, allowing other organizations to automatically incorporate your own data (e.g., a state transportation agency could gather up all localities' transportation data)
* you can either upload files to be stored in the repository or point the repository at an existing website address where the file lives

# Commercial Hosting

* little to no technical knowledge required
* they’ll hold your hand through the process
* your organization doesn’t have to provide any technical infrastructure (e.g., servers)

# Free Hosting

## DataHub

The Open Knowledge Foundation provides [DataHub](http://datahub.io/), a free, CKAN-based data host. It's a large, collective repository—users don’t get their own site, although it is possible to list only one’s own data, and share a URL that only lists those datasets.

## OpenData.city

A commercial host run by Ontodia, they provide [a free tier](http://www.opendata.city/pricing/) that includes 10GB of data storage, 20 datasets, and a custom subdomain (e.g., `http://springfield.opendata.city/`). It's CKAN-based.
