(Note: The below is just notes in outline form. It remains to flesh this out into a proper chapter.)

* data isn’t either open or closed—it’s a sliding scale, not a switch that gets flipped
* a popular assessment method is [5 Star Open Data](http://5stardata.info/)

|       |   |
|:------|:--|
|       | any format, no open license                             |
| ★     | any format, open license                                |
| ★★    | structured data, open license                           |
| ★★★   | structured data, open format, open license              |
| ★★★★  | structured data, open format, open license, URIs        |
| ★★★★★ | structured data, open format, open license, linked data |

* for detailed information about each of these levels, see [5 ★ Open Data](http://5stardata.info/)
* the fact that you’re reading this guide means that you’re going to do better than zero stars, but no better than three stars (sorry)
* you should really shoot for three stars for all of your data—structured data, open format, open license
* if you have important data that is only currently available in non-open formats (e.g., Excel) or even non-structured data (e.g., PDFs, Word), then go ahead and publish it in that format, because that's better than nothing, but move to publishing it as structured data in an open format as soon as practical
