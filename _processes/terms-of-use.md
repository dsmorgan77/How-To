(Note: The below is just notes in outline form. It remains to flesh this out into a proper chapter.)

* there is no need to have terms of service for provided data—it accomplishes nothing
* but government attorneys sometimes insist on it, and so you may be obliged to provide TOS
* if you must have terms of service, emulate [the TOS used by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for their open data repository](https://open.fda.gov/terms/)—in fact, _you can just take it_, since it's an uncopyrightable U.S. government work, replace every mention of the FDA with the name of your own organization, change the references to federal law to state law, and use it
