# Value

Unlike many agencies, agricultural agencies collect data for the purpose of benefiting industry. Crop yields, livestock brands, land rental prices—all of this is about helping farmers understand how to maximize yield and minimize costs.

# Data

## Inspections of regulated private facilities

State and municipal agencies’ inspection reports for grocery stores, dairies, non-USDA slaughterhouses, etc.

## Crop yields

The National Agricultural Statistics Service publishes crop yield data with a state level of granularity. This data can be extracted for republication on state data repositories. Both current and historical data is valuable.

## Land rental prices

[The National Agricultural Statistics Service tracks land rental prices](http://www.nass.usda.gov/Charts_and_Maps/Land_Values_and_Cash_Rents/) with a county level of granularity. This data can be extracted on a municipal, regional, or state level for republication.

## Water availability and usage

West of the Mississippi, states allocate and track agriculture use of water closely.

## Livestock brand books

Many states publish brand books (e.g., [Nevada](http://agri.nv.gov/Animals/Livestock/Brand_Book/), [Missouri](http://agriculture.mo.gov/animals/brandbook/), [South Dakota](http://brands.sd.gov/)), which are the registries for individual cattle brands. This is the public record of the ownership of animals with a given brand.
