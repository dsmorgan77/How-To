## Data

* councils, including geodata of their boundaries

## Comments

Councils of governments can be really powerful methods for aggregating data. Their members frequently need to share data with one another. Often the councils require data from their members in order to function. This makes them an ideal organization to promote the value of open data to local governments, and to push them to produce it, so that they may work more efficiently.
